- Fixed handling of tab tracking mode changes

## 2. Background Script (background.js)
- Added proper tab tracking settings management
- Improved connection handling with better state management
- Added logic to check if logs should be sent based on tab tracking settings
- Implemented pending logs handling to ensure logs are sent when reconnected
- Added handlers for tab tracking mode changes

## 3. Server (server.js)
- Added handleConsoleLog method to properly process and forward console logs

## 4. Popup UI (popup.html and popup.js)

## How to Use
1. Connect to the server using the popup UI
2. Toggle 'Track All Tabs' on to capture logs from all tabs, or off to only track selected tabs
3. When tracking selected tabs, use the tab selector in the server UI to choose which tabs to track
4. Console logs will now be properly captured and sent to the server based on your tracking settings
